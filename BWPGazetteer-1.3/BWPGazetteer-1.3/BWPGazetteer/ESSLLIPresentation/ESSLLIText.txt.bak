Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo was born in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. 
He came to Europe with a scholarship from the Programme Alßan to study in the European M.Sc. in Computational Logic.
During his studies, he got to know GATE. 
He saw that GATE's Default Gazetteer does not find words with typing mistakes, noise, mutations, corruptions...
Therefore he decided to program a Gazetteer capable of approximate matching based on Levenshtein distance.
He found the result interesting and he wrote a paper to ESSLLI.
Fortunately Kurt Gödel Society funded his participation and now he is here.
He hopes that his plugin can be useful for some of you.
