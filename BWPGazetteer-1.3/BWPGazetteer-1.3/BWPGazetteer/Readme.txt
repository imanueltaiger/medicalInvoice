This code implements an approximate gazetteer for GATE, able to handle texts with noise and errors.

It was developed by Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo (bruno.wp@gmail.com ; http://planeta.terra.com.br/arte/lua/), as a project for the Natural Language Processing course in the summer semester 2006 at the Technische Universität Dresden (Germany).
